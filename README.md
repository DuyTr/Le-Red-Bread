##### My thought on the project :+1: :

Le Red Bread is a multi-page website that shows the benefits of using any CMS, in this case wordpress. The business owner can have control of the website without affecting the works of developers. It is easy to manage. Developer can write much less code because WordPress uses the query string to decide which template or set of templates should be used to display the page. 

It was quite challeging to understand the wordpress heirachy templates. But once you get it, things will be much easier and wordpress become so realible and fun to work with.
